## 1. Counterexample Problems

### Problem A_1: [Identifying Missing Requirements]

**Task Description:**  
Given a project and a set of requirements designed to achieve the project, identify or correct missing and incomplete requirements.

**Starter Code:**

### 2. Guidelines that didn't work for Problem A_1

#### Guideline 1: [Try asking for concrete cases when things go wrong (Pre-Mortem Prompting)]

**Guideline Definition**

Description:
Ask the LLM to assume the system failed, then work backward to identify missing requirements.

Reasoning:
Pre-mortems and misuse cases create realistic, safety/security-focused requirements tied to real
failure modes.

**Prompt and Context:**

Context: (https://github.com/Xavier-Schneider/LLMs-for-Software-Engineering-Week4-Feedback/blob/main/ProblemA1.md)

Prompt: Assume a data breach occurred. What privacy/security requirement was missing?

**Solution or Output generated by GitHub Copilot:**  

GitHub Copilot: Most likely missing: strong encryption plus strict access controls and detection.

- Encryption: Sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit with proper key management.  
- Access control Principle of least privilege, role-based access, and multifactor authentication.  
- Logging & detection Comprehensive audit logs, real‑time monitoring/IDS, and alerting to detect exfiltration.  
- Incident response Formal breach response plan, playbooks, and notification procedures.  
- Data minimization & retention Only collect/store necessary data and securely purge when no longer needed.  
- Secure devops Timely patching, vulnerability scanning/pen testing, and secure credential handling (no plaintext secrets).  

...

**Analysis:**

As we can see, many of these requirements are duplicates from ProblemA1.md. Encryption for data, Secure user authentication, and Audit logs are already documented requirements. This guideline suffers from underspecification - i.e. rather than taking into account the existing requirements before generating new ones, Copilot has simply regurgitated the same information.

### 3. New and Updated Guidelines that worked for Problem A_1

#### Guideline 1: [Try asking for an assement of missing/incomplete requirements]
**Prompt and Context:**

Context: (https://github.com/Xavier-Schneider/LLMs-for-Software-Engineering-Week4-Feedback/blob/main/ProblemA1.md)

User: Assess each security requirement. Are any of them incomplete/missing?

**Solution or Output generated by GitHub Copilot:**  


GitHub Copilot: I'll create a short plan (todo list) for reviewing the security requirements.

Summary — current `Security & Privacy` items
- Listed: Secure user authentication; Role-based authorization; Encryption for data at rest and in transit; Private and public event visibility controls; Audit logs for shared calendar changes.
- High-level: All five are good topics but written at a high level — each is incomplete and needs concrete, testable details.

What's incomplete / missing (concise)
- Authentication (incomplete): No requirements for MFA, SSO/OAuth, password storage (hashing algorithm), session management, account lockout, brute-force protection, or recovery flows.
- Authorization (incomplete): No detail on granularity (per-calendar/event ACLs), default-deny, admin roles, permission change procedures, or least-privilege enforcement.
- Encryption (incomplete): Missing specifics: required TLS versions/ciphers, HSTS, algorithm for at-rest encryption, key management/KMS, key rotation, and where encryption is applied (DB, backups, mobile cache).
- Visibility & sharing (incomplete): Lacks defaults (private vs public), ephemeral/public link controls, revocation, ICS export privacy implications, and UI affordances for sharing consent.
- Audit logging (incomplete): Missing what to log (creates/edits/deletes/shares/permissions), log integrity (append-only, tamper-evidence), retention, access controls, and alerting/SIEM integration.
- Missing security areas (not in file):
  - Data protection & privacy: data retention policy, deletion/export (right to be forgotten), PII handling, consent, compliance (GDPR/CCPA).
  - API security: authenticated APIs, OAuth scopes, rate limiting, input validation, CSRF/CORS/CSP protections.
  - Secure development lifecycle: code review, dependency scanning, vulnerability/pen-test cadence.
  - Incident response & monitoring: IDS/SIEM, alerting, breach notification timelines.
  - Secrets & key management: secure storage, rotation, least-privilege for keys.
  - Backup security: encrypted backups, access controls, restore testing.
  - Admin/privileged access controls: MFA for admins, separate admin tooling, logging of admin actions.
  - Third-party integrations: vetting, token scoping, revocation.
  - Abuse protection & DoS: rate limits, throttling, DDoS mitigations.
  - Mobile/local storage security: secure storage, encrypted local cache, push notification privacy.

Suggested concrete requirement examples
- Authentication (example): "Require MFA for all accounts; store passwords using Argon2id (parameters: m=65536,r=2,p=1); lock account after 5 failed attempts for 15 minutes; support SSO via OIDC."
- Encryption (example): "Enforce TLS 1.2+ with strong ciphers and HSTS; encrypt at rest using AES-256 with keys managed in a KMS; rotate keys every 90 days."
- Audit logging (example): "Log create/edit/delete/share/permission-change events with actor, timestamp, resource id, and old/new values; retain logs 365 days; protect logs with append-only storage and role-based access."

...

**Analysis:**
As we can see, rather than duplicating requirements, Copilot has made suggestions for improving underspecified requirements (Authorization, Encryption) and has identified new requirements (Data protection and Privacy (GDPR), Third-party integrations, etc.). Importantly, it has clearly distiguished between pre-existing requirements and newly suggested requirements instead of mixing them together as was the case previously.

### Problem B_1: Transcribing Dirty Transcript Data

**Task Description:**  
Sometimes in life, you get unlucky and have to deal with poorly formatted transcript data. Your goal in this task is to get an LLM to convert a poorly formatted transcript in which a journalist talks to a user about LLMs into a clean, well-formatted JSON representation that cleanly separates what the journalist asks from what the user says in response.

Credit:
ChatGPT 5.2 generated the original clean transcript. We altered it to make the formatting significantly worse.

**Starter Code:**  
You can find all related files here: https://github.com/Xavier-Schneider/LLMs-for-Software-Engineering-Week4-Feedback

### Problem B_2: Clean up the transcript

**Task Description:**  
Your next task is to clean up the transcript. Prompt the LLM to convert the text in the json file from upper case back to sentence-case (normal text). Also, ensure that the LLM outputs the text line by line in the correct order of the transcript. Save this to a new markdown file.

**Starter Code:**  
You can reuse the files from B_1 for this task.

---

### Problem B_3: Summarize in 5 words or fewer

**Task Description:**  
Your final task for this problem is to have the LLM summarize the user's answers (only the user's answers) in 5 words or fewer. Make sure the LLM doesn't modify the cleaned-up transcript; instead, create a new markdown file to store the results.

**Starter Code:**  
You can reuse the files from B_1 for this task.
